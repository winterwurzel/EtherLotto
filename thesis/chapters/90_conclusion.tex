As this Project Work shows, it is possible to build a self-regulating Lottery application which holds all currency bet until a winner can be determined. 

Using this approach is not only fully transparent, due to the implementation of the Ethereum Blockchain and Smart COntracts, but also provably fair to everyone who places bids in the Lottery.
